        <span> Hello! My name is Susan Quinones. I live with my sibling and my mom 
        in Brooklyn, New York. I won't show you my face because I don't
        want people knowing my true idenity( plus I don't like how people judge 
        someone by their appearance so I'd like to keep it that way;). I love to
        draw, eat, sleep(whenever I get the chance), and watch a lot of cartoons/
        anime. I'm a shipper of Starco and Bbrae. I adore animals more than humans. 
        I'm not that good at socializing but I'm working on that. And I know that 
        all of this stuff is random about me but I'm not that good at telling
        people about myself so please give me some slack.</span>
