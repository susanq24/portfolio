      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/html/4d1ee4d40d">This project is advertising
      a bakery/ food buffet for animal companians. I wanted to create a some bit of
      paridise for animals to make them feel appreicated. Some challenges I face while
      completing this project includes thinking of the food ideas, figuring out the 
      location, and my target audience. The first thing I thought of was how to contribute
      food with something else other than humans. Than I thought of the animals. I wanted 
      to do something nice for them and I came across of making food for them. That's I 
      could think of at the time but it worked out pretty well!</a></span>
      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/html/51b931b081">This project is a little bland
      but I made it work. My class doing a recipy project and all I could think was the 
      sanwhich I made during the weekend that my family fell in love with. Some challenges
      I face while completing this project includes thinking about the steps, and trying
      to make it clear for the cook to follow along. It was pretty difficult for me to write 
      each step clearly because i'm very terrible at explaining stuff. It would definately
      be better if I just showed you a video of me making it since I made the sandwich 
      myself.</a></span>
      <span><a href="https://trinket.io/html/7717479d00">This project is just a short funny
      comic to make someone's day( well, If you get dark humor).Some challenges I face while
      completing this project includes making dialogue...that's actually it. It wasn't that 
      hard to copy and paste the image three times.</a></span>
